# About this page and the monkey

I'm just a guy trying to learn some things about coding and computer science. But with a field as wide and complex as this ... I often feel like **a coding monkey** ...

... since I'm also a passionate rock climber the title of this site makes even more sense. My name is Gregor Minnemann and I'm a *Computer Science* student at [Fernuniversit√§t Hagen](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de). I started this site to have a place, where I can organize my notes, share my work and keep a personal blog. Maybe the knowledge I'll collect on this page is of any use to somebody out there.
