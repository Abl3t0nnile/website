# Language specific resources

This folder contains everything coding language related. Since I currently use *Python* and *Swift*, the resources found on this page will be mainly on these topics. Besides that, there will be some things about shell scripting, markdown and git around here.

The main programming language for all Apple devices. Although it's also supported on *Linux* and *Windows*. It's the predecessor to Objective-C and a highly modern language, with easy to read syntax.

This is where it all started for me. Python was my first contact with coding. But since Python is quite restricted or difficult to deal with, when it comes to UI applications, I started to look somewhere else. But Python is still a tool in my belt and I plan to extend my knowledge on the language.
