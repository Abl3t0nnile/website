# Language specific resources

This folder contains everything coding language related. Since I currently use *Python* and *Swift*, the resources found on this page will be mainly on these topics. Besides that, there will be some things about shell scripting, markdown and git around here.

## [Swift](/docs/library/swift)

*Swift* is the main programming language for all Apple devices. Although it's also supported on Linux and Windows. It's the predecessor to Objective-C and a highly modern language, with easy to read syntax.

## [Python](/docs/library/python)

---

This is where it all started for me. *Python* was my first contact with coding. But since Python is quite restricted or difficult to deal with, when it comes to UI applications, I started to look somewhere else. But Python is still a tool in my belt and I plan to extend my knowledge on the language.

## [Markdown](/docs/library/markdown)

*Markdown* is a simple and easy to use markdown language. It's the main tool for content creation on this website. The articles found here cover everything you need to build content for a page like this one.
