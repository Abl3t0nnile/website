Markdown is the back bone of this website, since all content is created with it.

**[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)** says:

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.
