**[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)** says:

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

The language is the back bone of this website, since all content is created with it.
